I am building a simple stock app that will provide user track on the hightest æ¶¨å¹… stocks and fastest growing stocks. Since it has a high requirement for speed, I have just bought a real-time API that provides callback/handle functions. But the api only allows monitoring 1000 stocks at a time (unsubscribing takes 1 minute to effect). So my question is what kind of mechanism should I design to take advantage of these 1000 subscriptions, since the "fastest growing stocks" may happen out of nowhere, which can not be predicted. 

Actually, I have another api that is free but takes seconds (need to varify) to fetch realtime stock data, we need to actively post requests for data not a callback/handler. This can be a aid for change the subscription, please try to provide me a good design that can take advantage of these two apis.

This is a classic problem in real-time stock monitoring where you must balance between:

A fast but limited real-time stream API (with 1000-symbol constraint, slow unsubscribe).

A slow but broad active polling API (no hard limit, but latency in seconds).

The key is to prioritize symbol selection dynamically: constantly reevaluate whatâ€™s worth subscribing to in the fast API, using the slower API to discover emerging candidates.

ðŸŽ¯ Design Goal
Maximize the likelihood that the topæ¶¨å¹… and fastest-moving stocks are always within the 1000 real-time monitored stocks, despite their unpredictable emergence.

ðŸ§© Component Breakdown
1. Candidate Stock Scanner (Slow API Poller)
Every N seconds (e.g. 5â€“10s), scan all stocks using the slower API.

Compute short-term delta % (æ¶¨å¹…, price change %, etc.).

Maintain a ranking list of, say, top 1000â€“2000 fastest movers.

Use a cooldown period or debounce filter to avoid transient noise.

2. Subscription Manager
Maintain a priority queue or score-based heap for the top 1000 stocks to subscribe to.

If a stock's rank rises into the top X, and it's not already subscribed, enqueue it.

If the real-time subscription is full:

Remove the lowest priority stock (with a 1-minute buffer awareness).

Add the new high-priority stock to the pending subscription queue.

Implement a rolling subscription window, respecting the 1-minute unsubscription lag.

Keep a shadow table of:

python

Edit
{
  symbol: {
    "subscribed": True,
    "last_score": ...,
    "subscribe_time": ...,  # for unsubscription timeout
  }
}
3. Real-Time Tracker
Monitor all real-time subscribed stocks.

Update your live leaderboard of topæ¶¨å¹…/velocity/volatility stocks.

Send live updates to users.
